    "\n",
    "Data science and data analytics both serve crucial roles in extracting value from data, but their focuses differ. `Data science is an overarching field that uses methods including machine learning and predictive analytics, to draw insights from data`. In contrast, `data analytics concentrates on processing and performing statistical analysis on existing datasets to answer specific questions`."
